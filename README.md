# Hybrid-BLE-Solar-IoT-Health-Application
 
Keywords: Arduino Œùano 33 BLE Sense, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, nrf Cloud, nrf Connect, ThingSpeak, MATLAB, ECG, Solar Energy App.

This project concerns the implementation of a health application, which will enable the recording of a person's health through a heart rate sensor, the subsequent transmission of medical data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and in the final stage of their transmission of data on a Cloud platform.

The energy requirements of the application are covered by solar energy collection and management systems.

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board, the AD8232 sensor (ECG Sensor), the Android App nrf Connect, the IoT nrf Cloud platform, the MATLAB and the IoT ThingSpeak platform were used to develop the application.

Solar energy collection and management is achieved through a Solar Power Management Module, a compatible solar panel, a solar PowerBank and a long-lasting rechargeable battery. The contribution of the application is briefly described by the achievement of a wireless body area network (WBAN), through the combined use of wearable sensors, solar energy collection systems and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) data transmission. The prototypes of the present application in relation to similar applications that record biological data, are 
a) its portability and energy autonomy through solar energy collection and management systems,
b) the integration of the new Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board in health applications, 
c) the use of the new ArduinoBle library to develop an application that achieves BLE transmission of heart rate data; and 
d) send and record BLE data on IoT Cloud platforms, both externally and internally, for later processing and remote control by a specialist doctor.
